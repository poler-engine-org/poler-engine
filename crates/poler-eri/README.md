# POLER-ERI v3.0.1

**Quantum-Inspired ERI Meta-Compiler with R1CS + Crystallization + Archetype Algebra**

## What Is This?

POLER-ERI is a meta-compiler that generates optimized Rust code for computing
electron repulsion integrals (ERIs) in quantum chemistry. It does NOT compute
integrals directly — instead, it **compiles the mathematical recipe** for each
integral type into flat, zero-alloc, SIMD-ready Rust source code.

## What's New in v3.0.1

### Archetype Equation from the Algebra of Senses

v3.0.1 introduces the **Algebra of Senses** A = (O, ⊕, ⊗_ε), where:

- **O** is the set of semantic (computational) elements
- **⊕** is the direct sum (superposition of code fragments)
- **⊗_ε** is the topologically deformed tensor product with parameter ε

An **archetype** is a non-trivial idempotent element a ∈ O satisfying:

```
a ⊗_ε a = a    (Idempotency: re-compilation produces the same code)
a ⊗_ε e = a    (Neutrality: the archetype is self-sufficient)
a ≠ e           (Non-triviality: the archetype is not the vacuum)
```

And any fixed point of the SCF iteration satisfies:

```
p* = a ⊗_ε p*  (Fixed-point: convergence is guaranteed)
```

**Derivation** (4 axioms of tensor algebra):

1. **Associativity**: (x ⊗_ε y) ⊗_ε z = x ⊗_ε (y ⊗_ε z)
2. **Distributivity**: x ⊗_ε (y ⊕ z) = (x ⊗_ε y) ⊕ (x ⊗_ε z)
3. **Neutral element**: x ⊗_ε e = e ⊗_ε x = x
4. **Topological continuity**: ⊕ and ⊗_ε are continuous

From axioms 1-3: L_a² = L_a → a ⊗_ε a = a (evaluating at x = e)
From axiom 4: if p_t → p*, then p* = a ⊗_ε p* (continuity of ⊗_ε)

### Cryptographic Verification

The idempotency a ⊗_ε a = a provides a natural **hash function**:
if you compile the same circuit twice and get different results, something is wrong.

- **Fingerprint**: 64-bit hash of each archetype's circuit structure
- **Merkle tree**: Single root hash committing to all archetypes
- **Signed modules**: Generated code with cryptographic integrity proof

### Reverse Meta-Compiler

The inverse of crystallization: given source code (C/Python/Rust), extract
the underlying archetype and re-crystallize it into optimized Rust.

### One-Keystroke Pipeline

```
poler-eri one-key --max-am 3
```

Builds archetypes → Crystallizes → Verifies → Signs → Outputs code with integrity proof.

## How It Works

The meta-compiler uses a 3-stage pipeline (plus archetype/crypto layers):

```
Shell quartet (la,lb,lc,ld)
        |
        v
  [1] CircuitBuilder
        |   Builds an R1CS (Rank-1 Constraint System) circuit
        |   representing the VRR+HRR recurrence relations.
        |   Each gate: result = cL * operand[left] + cR * operand[right]
        v
  [2] VrrCrystallizer
        |   Flattens the circuit into linear Rust code.
        |   No loops. No branches. No allocations.
        |   Just: operands[i] = coeff * operands[j] + coeff * operands[k]
        v
  [3] BatchCompiler
        |   Iterates over ALL shell quartets up to MAX_AM.
        |   Writes each crystallized function to generated/eri_XYZW.rs
        |   Generates mod.rs with all module declarations.
        v
  [4] ArchetypeRegistry  (NEW in v3.0.1)
        |   Maps each quartet to an archetype a ⊗_ε a = a
        |   Verifies idempotency and fixed-point properties
        v
  [5] CryptoVerifier  (NEW in v3.0.1)
        |   Builds Merkle tree of archetype fingerprints
        |   Signs each generated module
        |   Provides integrity proof for the entire codebase
        v
Generated Rust crate with ERI functions + cryptographic proof
```

### The 4-Stage ERI Pipeline

ERIs are computed via recurrence relations that reduce angular momentum:

```
VRR-A  →  Increase l on center A until target la is reached
HRR-bra →  Transfer l from A to B (horizontal shift)
VRR-C  →  Increase l on center C until target lc is reached
  (with cross-terms from A and B — this was the critical bug in v0.5-v1.0)
HRR-ket →  Transfer l from C to D (horizontal shift)
```

### R1CS Gate Format

```
result = coeff_left * operand[left] + coeff_right * operand[right]
```

Where coefficients can be:
- `Zero` / `One` — trivial
- `Scalar(f64)` — a numeric constant
- `Prefactor(usize)` — index into a prefactor array (computed at runtime from geometry)
- `BoyF(usize)` — Boys function F_m(T)
- `Operand(usize)` — reference to a previously computed operand

## The Archetype Equation and Cryptography

The archetype equation `a ⊗_ε a = a` is not just a mathematical curiosity — it
is the foundation of the cryptographic verification system:

1. **Idempotency = Collision Resistance**: If you compile the same circuit twice
   and get different code, the fingerprint changes. This is equivalent to a hash
   collision in the crystallizer.

2. **Fixed Point = Determinism**: The SCF iteration converges to a unique fixed
   point p* = a ⊗_ε p*. This means the generated code is deterministic — the
   same input always produces the same output.

3. **Topological Continuity = Avalanche Effect**: Small changes in the circuit
   (e.g., changing one gate) produce small changes in the fingerprint. This is
   the cryptographic avalanche property.

4. **Merkle Tree = Commitment**: The root hash commits to the entire codebase.
   Any change to any archetype changes the root hash, making it impossible to
   tamper with generated code without detection.

## The Bootstrapping Vision

The long-term goal is to **run the meta-compiler through itself**:

1. **Stage 1** (current): BatchCompiler auto-iterates all quartets to MAX_AM
2. **Stage 2**: C/Python parser frontend — feed libcint/PySCF source directly
3. **Stage 3**: Meta-compiler compiles itself — true bootstrapping

The archetype equation ensures that bootstrapping is safe: if the compiler
produces itself (a ⊗_ε a = a), the result is verified by construction.

## Dependencies

- `libm` — math functions (sqrt, exp, etc.) for no_std compatibility

No other dependencies. The project is intentionally minimal.
